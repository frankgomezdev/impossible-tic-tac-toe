# impossible-tic-tac-toe

Impossible Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple project that I've created. With HTML and CSS, I was able to create a simple board where the game will take place. With JavaScript and some DOM Manipulation, the human player and AI player will take turns placing their symbols on the board until there is a winner or the game is tied. The game is called "Impossible Tic-Tac-Toe" because I implemented the minimax algorithm (read more [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37/)) to make the AI unbeatable.
